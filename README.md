# Stride-Jump

**IMPORTANT** This game is no longer maintained. Stride Jump was a project that I started prior to my Freshman year of highschool and is reflective of my early interest in programming. The code is poorly written not not well documented. However, I'm leaving this repository public for historical purposes as this is one of my first completed (i.e., not abandoned) personal projects.

---

 Build this game in Unity.
 
 Current version on source: 1.0 
 
A simple jumper-style game.

The game and repository has been renamed to it's final name, Stride Jump! Internaly (except for the repository name), it will still be referenced as Project Scroll.

This source contains a keystore. When building, build it without the keystore. This will disable Google Play Games (it will attempt to log in, but will fail and the game will continue as normal.)

## Controls:

Tilt the device to move, tap the jump. You can jump twice whilst in the air.

## Credits:

Most of the programming and stuff is done by Phil (PJBeans). The music is made by Paul "Lucky Luis" Priebe.
