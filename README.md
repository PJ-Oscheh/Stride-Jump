The game and repository has been renamed to it's final name, Instinct Jump! Internaly (except for the repository name), it will still be referenced as Project Scroll.

Tilt the device to move, tap the jump. You can jump twice whilst in the air.

Most of the programming and stuff is done by Phil (PJBeans). The music is made by Paul "Lucky Luis" Priebe.
