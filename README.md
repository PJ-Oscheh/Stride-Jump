# Project-Scroll
 Build this game in Unity.

A simple jumper-style game.

The graphics are just place holders. After I get the main concept completed, I'll implement better graphics.

Idk why it's called Project Scroll. I couln't think of a name so that popped in my head. It will, obviously, be renamed by the time the final release is ready.
## Controls:

Tilt the device to move, tap the jump. You can jump twice whilst in the air.

## Credits:

Most of the programming and stuff is done by Phil (PJBeans). The music is made by Paul "Lucky Luis" Priebe

## Platforms:

- Android
- **Possibly** Windows 10 Mobile
