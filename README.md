# Project-Scroll
 Build this game in Unity.

A simple jumper-style game.

The graphics are just place holders. After I get the main concept completed, I'll implement better graphics.
## Controls:

Tilt the device to move, tap the jump. You can jump twice whilst in the air.

## Platforms:

- Android
- **Possibly** Windows 10 Mobile
